# Postgirl
Postgirl: The lightweight PWA version of Postman. Created by a girl ðŸ‘§

See the latest deployed version here -> https://postgirl.netlify.app/

### it's a responsive PWA!
This is a learning project created to acquire abilities on PWA and cool dark-mode UIs. The interface was created using my [open-source Design System: Momo UI](https://github.com/super-y-s-developers/momo-ui) which supports custom themes

You can use it on your pc/mobile phone browser, or install it to your desktop or home.

### screenshots
OK, the followings are Figma screenshots. You got me. But the UI already looks almost as the designs. 
Most of the features are still in progress, but you can see do requests and get responses.
